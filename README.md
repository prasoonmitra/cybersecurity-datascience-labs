Hi, I'm Prasoon

I'm a rising second-year Computer Engineering student at Georgia Tech with a strong interest in cybersecurity. I am motivated to protect data from cyber criminals in order to help businesses achieve their goals.

I value learning modern technologies such as the use of Artifical Intelligence to defend against advanced cyber attacks.
